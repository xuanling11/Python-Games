# The Complete Magic 8 Ball:



# Import the random module
import random

# The possible numbers are between 0 through 21 inclusive
# (that means 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ... 21)
# and each number should translate to a fortune
# A standard Magic 8 Ball has twenty possible answers, 
# including ten affirmative answers, five non-committal answers 
# , and five negative answers.
# Here are following:

# Ten affirmative answers:
# 0 - It is certain!
# 1 - It is decidedly so!
# 2 - Without a doubt!
# 3 - Yes definitely!
# 4 - You may rely on it...
# 5 - As I see it, yes!
# 6 - Most likely...
# 7 - Outlook good!
# 8 - Yes!
# 9 - Signs point to yes...
# 10 - As I see it, yes!
# 11 - Most likely...

# Five non-committal answers
# 12 - Reply hazy, try again!
# 13 - Ask again later...
# 14 - Better not tell you now!
# 15 - Cannot predict now!
# 16 - Concentrate and ask again!

# Five negative answers
# 17 - Don't count on it!
# 18 - My reply is no.
# 19 - My sources say no.
# 20 - Outlook not so good...
# 21 - Very doubtful!

#
# If somehow the function gets a number other than those 8
# it should send back a string saying that
# something was wrong with the input.

def number_to_fortune(number):
    # Fill in your code here.
    # Use an if...elif...else statement
    # to check each of the numbers between 0 and 21
    # and return the fortune as a string.
